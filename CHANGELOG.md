## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **SSO admin UI: surface the SAML `use_absolute_acs_url` opt-in** (#521) - backfills the per-provider toggle the backend added (migration 139) but the admin UI never surfaced (the "lockstep debt"). The SAML provider form gains a **Use absolute ACS URL** switch in the Sign Requests / Require Signed Assertions group, for stricter SAML 2.0 IdPs that reject relative AssertionConsumerServiceURLs (e.g. Lark AnyCross). Off by default (pre-138 wire format), sourced from the loaded config, and echoed on create + update. `src/types/sso.ts` and the `adaptSamlConfig` adapter propagate the field with a defensive `false` default so the UI is safe to deploy against a backend that predates the column. (The sibling OIDC `allow_legacy_rsa_keys` toggle, #522, is deferred to v1.4.0 to stay in lockstep with its still-open backend PR.)
- **`release/1.1.x` maintenance branch + `:1.1-dev` Docker tag rule** (#331) - mirrors `artifact-keeper#890`; pushes to `release/1.1.x` now publish `ghcr.io/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-web:1.1-dev` so the v1.1.x release-gate can test a true v1.1.x web/backend pair.

### Changed
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to sso (final batch)** (#359 batch 9) - replaced all 30 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/sso.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. 7 read adapters (SsoProvider / OidcConfig / LdapConfig / SamlConfig / LdapTestResult / TokenPair) and 6 write adapters covering the OIDC/LDAP/SAML create+update request shapes. Provider type narrowed via `narrowEnum` to the local `oidc | ldap | saml` union. The SDK declares attribute_mapping values as `unknown` while the local types declare them as string; the adapter coerces non-strings defensively. `ldapLogin` runtime-narrows the SDK's `unknown` 200 response to extract the access/refresh token pair. Closes #359 in full.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to security** (#359 batch 8) - replaced all 25 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/security.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. 9 read adapters (Dashboard / Score / Scan / ScanList / Finding / FindingList / Policy / ScanConfig / RepoSecurity / TriggerScanResponse) and 4 write adapters (TriggerRequest / CreatePolicyRequest / UpdatePolicyRequest / UpsertScanConfigRequest). The Score adapter synthesizes `total_findings` from severity counts since the SDK ScoreResponse doesn't expose it directly. SDK PolicyResponse has additional fields the local ScanPolicy doesn't model (`max_artifact_age_days`, `min_staging_hours`, `require_signature`) which the adapter intentionally drops — those are consumed by the lifecycle module, not security.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to promotion** (#359 batch 7) - replaced 9 of 10 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/promotion.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for `severity` (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`/`info`) and `PromotionHistoryStatus` (`promoted`/`rejected`/`pending_approval`). One `as unknown as` retained inline for `policy_result` (the SDK exposes the field as an opaque key/value bag, the local type declares a typed `PolicyEvaluationResult` that consumers only access lazily — bridge documented). Also exports `adaptArtifact` / `adaptArtifactList` from `artifacts.ts` and `adaptRepository` / `adaptRepositoryList` from `repositories.ts` so promotion can reuse them rather than re-implementing.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to dependency-track** (#359 batch 6) - replaced all 12 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/dependency-track.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. The SDK declares every metric counter on `DtProjectMetrics` / `DtPortfolioMetrics` as optional; the local types declare them as required `: number`. Adapters coerce undefined → 0 so an empty backend response renders numeric zeros in the metrics card instead of "undefined". Nested adapters for `DtFinding` (component / vulnerability / analysis / attribution / cwe / license) preserve existing render behavior.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to sbom** (#359 batch 5) - replaced all 21 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/sbom.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and exported `narrowCveStatus` / `narrowPolicyAction` helpers for callers that want a typed status. Multiple SDK shape mismatches are now explicit and documented: `LicenseCheckResult` is synthesized (SDK returns `violations: string[]` with no `action`; adapter coerces to `{license, reason}` rows and derives `action: "block"|"allow"` from `compliant`); `getByArtifact` no longer accepts a `format` query param (the SDK has no query and the backend ignored it pre-#359). No app consumer surfaces these endpoints today, so the synthesis is best-effort and documented inline. Other endpoints (generate/list/get/getComponents/convert/getCveHistory/updateCveStatus/getCveTrends/list-get-upsert-deletePolicy) round-trip pages unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to replication** (#359 batch 4) - replaced all 11 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/replication.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for the `PeerStatus` union. Dropped three dead fields from `PeerInstance` (`api_key`/`sync_filter`/`updated_at`) and one from `PeerConnection` (`source_peer_id`) — all four were declared on the local types but never populated by the SDK and never read by any consumer (verified via grep). The peers list and connections table render unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to telemetry** (#359 batch 3) - replaced all 9 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/telemetry.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and explicit body forwarding. CrashReport's optional+nullable fields (`stack_trace`, `os_info`, `uptime_seconds`, `submitted_at`, `submission_error`) now normalize undefined → null. Pages that consume this API are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to webhooks + analytics** (#359 batch 2) - replaced all 9 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/webhooks.ts` and all 11 in `src/lib/api/analytics.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for the `WebhookEvent` string-to-union narrowing. Webhook events that the web doesn't model yet now fall back to `artifact_uploaded` with a console warning instead of crashing render code expecting a known event. Pages that consume these APIs are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to monitoring + lifecycle** (#359 batch 1) - replaced all `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/monitoring.ts` and `src/lib/api/lifecycle.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. Adapters normalize the SDK's `?: string | null` (optional + nullable) shape to the local types' `: string | null` (required + nullable) shape so callers see a stable contract. Two `as unknown as` casts remain in `lifecycle.ts` and are commented inline: the SDK incorrectly types `createLifecyclePolicy` / `updateLifecyclePolicy` bodies as the security-policy request shape rather than the lifecycle request shape — to be removed when the generator is rebuilt against the corrected OpenAPI spec. Pages that consume these APIs are unchanged.
- **Admin Settings page now issues one HTTP call instead of three** (#349) - the page used to call `/api/v1/admin/settings` three times via separate `useQuery` hooks (one each for `password-policy`, `storage-settings`, `smtp-config`). Replaced with a single `admin-settings` query backed by new `settingsApi.getAllSettings()` and the `useAdminSettings()` hook. The SMTP tab consumes the same hook so react-query dedups it. Public per-getter API (`getPasswordPolicy` / `getStorageSettings` / `getSmtpConfig`) preserved for non-page consumers (e.g. the inline `PasswordPolicyHint`). Cuts settings page network round trips by 67%. **Behavioral note**: with one shared query, a malformed slice of the response (e.g. bad SMTP fields) now fails the whole bundle — Storage and Password Policy rows show "Unavailable" alongside the SMTP error, even though their fields parsed fine. Pre-PR these would have parsed independently. The trade-off is acceptable because all three slices come from the same endpoint and a malformed bundle is almost always a backend-wide problem; per-slice fault isolation is filed as a follow-up.
- **`toUserMessage` truncates user-untrusted error text at 240 chars** (#356) - prevents a 50KB stack trace or HTML 500 page from rendering as a wall of text in a toast. Truncated output is suffixed with `… [truncated, <n> more chars]` so it's clear the message was clipped. Author-controlled fallback strings are not truncated.
- **`toUserMessage` prefixes fallback with HTTP status code** (#355) - when an error carries an HTTP status (`.status` / `.statusCode` / `.body.status`) but the body has no useful message, the fallback now reads "(HTTP 409) Failed to create permission" instead of just "Failed to create permission" so a 409 Conflict differentiates from a 500 Internal Server Error in toast text. Backend-provided messages stay unchanged (no double-decoration). Closes the deferred half of #207.
- **Extract `mutationErrorToast` helper to deduplicate ~125 mutation `onError` callsites** (#354) - the pattern `onError: (err) => toast.error(toUserMessage(err, "Failed to <action>"))` was repeated across most pages; collapsed to `onError: mutationErrorToast("Failed to <action>")` in 36 files (-145 LOC). Centralizes future tweaks (HTTP status prefix, truncation, telemetry) to one place. User-visible toast strings are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — replace double-casts with adapters and zod** (#206) - removed all `as unknown as T` and `as never` casts in 15 of `src/lib/api/*.ts` files. Each SDK call now goes through an adapter function or a Set-backed narrowing helper that warns on unknown enum values. `assertData` (new in `fetch.ts`) rejects empty body responses with a contextual error. `settings.ts` uses zod `.safeParse()` at the trust boundary for `getPasswordPolicy`/`getSmtpConfig`. Public `xxxApi` return types unchanged so consumer code is untouched.

### Fixed
- **OIDC claim config keys now match the backend's `<field>_claim` schema** (#516) - the OIDC provider form wrote its claim overrides to `attribute_mapping` under the bare keys `username` / `email` / `groups` (plus `display_name`), but the backend (`sso.rs::resolve_oidc_claim_name`) only reads `username_claim` / `email_claim` / `groups_claim`, so every configured OIDC claim override was silently ignored — logins fell back to the built-in defaults regardless of what the operator typed. `handleSubmit` now writes the `_claim`-suffixed keys (`display_name_claim` too, for parity, though the backend does not consume it yet) and drops the legacy bare keys from the JSONB blob on save. The edit dialog reads the new keys with a fallback to the legacy keys so a provider saved by the pre-fix UI still displays its configured claim names. Unrelated `attribute_mapping` keys still round-trip (regression #406 preserved).
- **Extend SSE EVENT_TYPE_MAP to webhook/artifact/scan/backup/plugin events** (#213) - the per-domain map only covered 7 domains (users, groups, repositories, service accounts, permissions, quality gates, dashboard). When backend events fired for the missing domains over SSE, the UI didn't refetch stale data — operators had to hard-refresh. Adds 5 QUERY_KEYS (`WEBHOOKS`, `WEBHOOK_DELIVERIES`, `BACKUPS`, `SECURITY`, `PLUGINS`), 4 INVALIDATION_GROUPS (`webhooks`, `backups`, `security`, `plugins`), and 19 new event-type entries (`webhook.{created,updated,deleted,delivery}`, `artifact.{uploaded,deleted}`, `scan.{started,completed,failed}`, `finding.{acknowledged,acknowledgment_revoked}`, `backup.{created,completed,failed,restored}`, `plugin.{installed,uninstalled,enabled,disabled}`). Map size grew 20 → 39.
- **Setup Guide: sanitize repo keys for Gradle/SBT property names + clearer SSR placeholder** (#362, partial) - the Gradle credentials snippet emitted property names like `my-jvm-repoUsername` for hyphenated repo keys; technically legal in `gradle.properties` but looks broken to readers expecting identifier rules. Added a `repoKeyToGradleId` helper that camelCases kebab/dot/underscore separators and strips remaining non-alphanumerics. URLs and `<id>` slots keep the raw key — only property names sanitize. Also replaced the SSR fallback `https://artifacts.example.com` with `__REPLACE_WITH_REGISTRY_URL__` so prerendered HTML doesn't ship with a real-looking domain a user could accidentally copy. Remaining `repo_type` (proxy/virtual hides publish steps) and `is_public` (anonymous mode) fixes deferred to follow-up.
- **Per-artifact Security tab now surfaces native scan_findings** (#368) - the Security tab on the repository view (`security-tab-content.tsx`) used to show only SBOM CVE history and Dependency-Track findings, never the native `scan_findings` table. A user who triggered a scan via `POST /api/v1/security/scan` for a specific artifact had no way to see the resulting findings on the artifact's own page — they had to navigate to `/security/scans` and find the right scan ID by name+timestamp. New `ArtifactScansSection` component lists recent scan_results rows for the artifact (status / type / counts / completed_at) with a "View findings" link to the per-scan page. Sourced from `securityApi.listArtifactScans(artifact.id)` which already existed but had no consumer.
- **`getInstallCommand` returns Gradle/SBT-native snippets instead of Maven XML** (#361) - the JVM case in `package-utils.ts` returned the same `<dependency>` XML for all three of `maven` / `gradle` / `sbt`. Users browsing a Gradle-named repo saw Maven XML in the package detail / copy-snippet UI — same bug class #333 fixed on the Setup Guide page. Now `gradle` returns `implementation 'GROUP:name:version'` and `sbt` returns `libraryDependencies += "GROUP" % "name" % "version"`. Maven output is unchanged.
- **Surface load failures in `getPasswordPolicy` and `getSmtpConfig` instead of silently falling back to defaults** (#347) - both getters previously caught any SDK error or schema mismatch and returned baked-in defaults, so a backend outage rendered as plausible-looking placeholder values on the admin Settings page (same failure mode as #334). Now the getters throw on SDK error / unparseable response, and the page renders explicit "Unavailable" states (Password Policy row + SMTP tab error alert) so an operator can tell something's actually wrong.
- **`formatBytes` returns "--" for NaN/Infinity/negative input** (#348) - previously these inputs produced nonsense strings like "NaN undefined" or "Infinity undefined" visible on the admin Settings → Storage tab. Now returns the same `--` sentinel already used elsewhere in the package/search rendering paths. Also clamps the unit index for >TB values so multi-PB byte counts render as "<n> TB" rather than indexing past the units table.
- **SSO login button reads "Sign in with SSO" instead of generic provider names like "default"** (#351) - when an admin's SSO provider is named `default` / `primary` / `main` / `sso` (or empty/whitespace), the button now falls back to a protocol-aware label (`Sign in with SSO (OIDC)` / `(SAML)`) so users see what they're actually clicking. Real provider names like "Corp SSO" are preserved unchanged.
- **Login page hides username/password fields when only redirect SSO is configured** (#350) - previously the form rendered even when the only available auth method was OIDC/SAML, leaving the fields with no consumer. The form now hides when SSO providers exist and no LDAP provider is configured. Setup mode and the `?fallback=local` query param keep the form available for first-time setup and operator recovery. A loading skeleton during the SSO providers fetch prevents the form from briefly flashing visible. Heuristic stopgap until the backend exposes a public `local_auth_enabled` flag.
- **Migration Add Connection now lets users pick the source repository manager type** (#319) - the form previously had no Source Type field, so the backend silently defaulted every connection to Artifactory. Adds a Source Type Select with Artifactory + Nexus options (the two values the SDK currently accepts), threaded through types, the API adapter, the form state, and the create-connection mutation body. Default remains Artifactory to preserve prior behavior.
- **Setup Guide now shows correct client snippets for Gradle and SBT repos** (#333) - JVM-format repos (maven / gradle / sbt) previously rendered only Maven `pom.xml` / `settings.xml`. The dialog now offers Maven, Gradle (Groovy), Gradle (Kotlin), and SBT tabs with the correct credential and dependency snippets per client. Default tab tracks the repo's declared format so a Gradle repo opens on Gradle (Groovy).
- **Mutation errors now surface backend details instead of generic placeholders** (#207) - audited every TanStack Query `useMutation` and replaced opaque `onError: () => toast.error("Failed to ...")` callbacks with `toUserMessage(err, fallback)`-driven toasts. 91 callsites across 27 files. Also adds `onError` to 8 previously-silent mutations (security/policies/scans + repo-selector preview), and disambiguates the SSO toggle toasts per provider (OIDC/LDAP/SAML). `toUserMessage` now also reads FastAPI-style `.detail` fields so plugin-install errors (and any other FastAPI-shaped backend error) surface their server-side message.

### Accessibility
- **Aria attribute coverage on admin pages** (#208) - replaced `title` with `aria-label` on icon-only buttons (lifecycle, monitoring, quality-gates, sso, telemetry, groups, security/scans, file-viewer); paired form inputs with labels via `htmlFor`/`id`; added accessible names to `Switch` components. Per-row table action buttons (SSO providers, quality gates, lifecycle policies, telemetry crash reports, users, monitoring suppress) now interpolate the row's identifying name into the aria-label so screen readers can disambiguate. Newly accessible-named `Refresh` buttons on approvals, security, and migration pages.

### Security
- **Pin third-party GitHub Actions to commit SHAs** (#205) - every third-party `uses:` line in `codeql.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `docker-publish.yml`, and `stale.yml` is now pinned to a specific commit SHA (with a version comment) so an upstream tag rewrite cannot silently swap action code. `ci.yml` was already pinned and is the model. The same-org reusable workflow `artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-test/.github/workflows/release-gate.yml@main` (docker-publish.yml line 191) is intentionally tracked on `main` — same-org workflows inherit the org's branch-protection trust boundary, and pinning a reusable workflow to a SHA is operationally heavier. Dependabot is configured for `github-actions`, so bumps continue to flow through review.

### Notes
- **v1.1.8 web image is permanently unavailable** (#320) - the web release process stopped at v1.1.3 while the backend continued through v1.1.8. There is no v1.1.8 source ref to rebuild from; backfilling would falsify provenance. See [docs/release-history/v1.1.8-web-postmortem.md](docs/release-history/v1.1.8-web-postmortem.md). Recurrence is prevented by `artifact-keeper#882` (image-publish gate).
